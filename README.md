# SixNet
Initial checkin, still lots to do.  I've included a script to create database connections.  You'll need to update the connectionstrings in the config files.  

This version probably won't be very useful to anyone but myself - but I'll help anyone get up and running with it who is interested.

Some high points:

FULL PETSCII support throughout
ANSI support in all prompts/menus/editors
Online games (Empire and Dopewars already there as examples)
Graffiti wall
Message Bases
Text File areas
Functional XModem and Punter protocols for up/download
